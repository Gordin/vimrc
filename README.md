my vimrc
========
My own vim distribution, because janus and spf13 are just too much bloat...
Installation
--------
Clone this repo anywhere you like:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Gordin/vimrc.git vim
```
cd into the repo and run the setup script:
```bash
cd vim
sudo yaourt -S cmake clang nodejs #needs cmake, clang and npm. Probably also python and ruby
bash setup.sh
```
All your .vim* and .gvim* files will end up in an vim.old folder inside the `vim` folder you cloned
and will be replaced by symlinks to this repo.
